This is a tool I made for making simple modding easier, a sheet version is also being worked on

tools made by wisi

Setup: 

throw the nto folder into the root of your drive if you are going to want textures because thats where the tool searches for it or you can select a folder with TexSelect
when you open the tool hit the Workingfolder button that will go to where you are doing all of your work
make sure the tools and the files you want to work with are both in that folder you move to and it should work properly


select a base file from the top selection that pops up after picking a folder the one below is for .skbs which are optional for nmo2lwo,lwo2nmo,clb2lwo,lwo2clb. Select a tool, hit run and it should work


Tools:

nmo2lwo converts .nmo files to .lwo can also take a bunch of quadrant files and put them into one by using the quadrant options
lwo2nmo converts .lwo files to .nmo can cut a single .lwo into a bunch of quadrant files by using quadrant options
nto2img converts nto  files into images
img2nto reverse of nto2img
clb2lwo converts collision(clb) files to lwo files
lwo2clb reverse of clb2lwo
